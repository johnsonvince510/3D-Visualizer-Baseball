# 3D Baseball Hawk-Eye Visualizer

This project is a Vite-powered React application that renders a 3D Hawk-Eye pitch/bat visualizer.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or later (comes with npm)

## Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Vite prints a local development URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Open that address in your browser to interact with the app. Use the file picker in the left panel to load one or more Hawk-Eye JSON exports.

## Create a production build (optional)
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
`npm run build` outputs the static bundle to `dist/`. `npm run preview` serves that bundle locally so you can verify it before deploying.
